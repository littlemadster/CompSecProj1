# Compputer Security Project 2

This repo will encrypt and decrypt using the Vigenere Cipher and conduct cryptanalysis to find the key for a given ciphertext. 

The technique used includes some automation and calculation by the code and some user input and calculation. Classes were created to include different functions in respect to their ‘theme’ including ‘LanguageLetters,’ ‘CryptAnalysis,’ and ‘VigenereCrypt.’ 

Testing files were created to test each individual class and a combination of the classes. Each class and their tester file will be discussed further in the Classes and Testing Files sections.
