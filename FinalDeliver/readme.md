This is a project for CIS4367 Computer Security. The objective is to create a code that will take an input text to encrypt and decrypt using the Vigenere Cipher. An input for the key by the user will be used to attempt to find the key. The English Language probability of letters is used for cryptanalysis to see if the key is correct.
